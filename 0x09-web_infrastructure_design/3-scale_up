# 3. Scale Up

## Infrastructure Overview

Here is how the infrastructure from the secured and monitored setup is expanded:

- A new server is added.

- A second load balancer (HAProxy) is configured in a cluster for high availability.

- Components (web server, application server, database) are moved to their own dedicated servers.

## Components

1. Second Load Balancer (HAProxy in cluster mode)

- Why: This setup prevents a single point of failure. If one load balancer fails, the other seamlessly takes over to ensure continuous website availability.

- Cluster Setup: The load balancers are configured in an Active-Active or Active-Passive cluster, based on the specific performance and failover needs of the system.

2. Dedicated Web Server

- Why: By separating the web server from the application server, you increase efficiency. The web server can focus on serving static files (like HTML, CSS, and images) while the application server handles the more complex backend logic.

3. Dedicated Application Server

- Why: It handles the business logic and dynamic content generation, which allows for independent scaling. You can increase the resources of the application server as needed, without affecting the web server.

4. Dedicated Database Server

- Why: Isolating the database improves performance and security. This also makes it easier to scale the database independently, for instance, by adding replicas to handle a heavier load.

## Benefits of Scaling Up

- Availability: The system has no single point of failure, ensuring it remains online even if one component fails.

- Scalability: You can independently scale each layer (web, app, database) to handle increased traffic or resource needs.

- Performance: Each server is specialized for its role, leading to more efficient resource usage and better overall performance.

- Maintenance: Components can be updated or maintained in isolation without causing downtime for the entire website.

## Issues That May Still Exist

- Database is a Single Point of Failure: The database remains a single point of failure for write operations, as there is still only one primary database server.

- Increased Cost and Complexity: This expanded infrastructure is more complex to manage and, therefore, more expensive to set up and maintain.

- Potential Network Latency: Separating the components onto different servers can slightly increase network latency, which might impact response times if not properly optimized.
